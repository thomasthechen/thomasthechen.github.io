I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department of Stanford University. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by Professor [Tengyu Ma](https://ai.stanford.edu/~tengyuma/) and to collaborate closely with Professor [Zhiyuan Li](https://zhiyuanli.ttic.edu/). I studied Computer Science at Columbia University as an undergraduate, and I am very grateful to have been advised by Professors [Xi Chen](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~xichen/), [Henry Yuen](https://www.henryyuen.net/), and [Mihalis Yannakakis](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mihalis/). I am interested in using theoretical methods to understand Large Language Models.
